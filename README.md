### Contributing
If you wish to submit a pull request to fix bugs or broken behaviour feel free to do so. If you would like to add 
features or change existing behaviour or balance, please discuss it with Sengir or Krapht before submiting the pull request.

Do not submit pull requests which solely "fix" formatting. As these kinds of changes are usually very intrusive in commit history and everyone has their own idea what "proper formatting" is, they should be done by one of the main contributors. 
Please only submit "code cleanup", if the changes actually have a substantial impact on readability.

### Reporting issues
* Before reporting an issue, please check that it has not been reported before.
* Issues are for bugs/crashes, please do not use them to ask general questions.
* Always include the version you are having trouble with. Or if you're building from source, which source you're building.
If you don't, we might assume that you are using latest-greatest and waste a bunch of time trying to reproduce 
a problem that might have fixed been already. Such things makes for very grumpy devs. Grumpy devs spend 
less time coding and more time doing stuff that makes them less grumpy.
* If the issues occurs on a server, be sure it's a vanilla forge server and <b>not</b> a mcpc+ server.
* Issues with any logs mentioning Optifine will be closed on sight! Remove Optifine before reporting any issue.
